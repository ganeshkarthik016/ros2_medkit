# ReportFault.srv - Report a fault occurrence to the FaultManager.
#
# Called by FaultReporter clients or directly by nodes to report fault conditions.
# The FaultManager aggregates reports by fault_code across all sources.

# Request fields

# Global fault identifier. Convention: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., "MOTOR_OVERHEAT").
# Recommended max length: 64 characters. Allowed: A-Z, 0-9, underscore.
# Same fault_code from different sources = single aggregated fault.
string fault_code

# Severity level: 0=INFO, 1=WARN, 2=ERROR, 3=CRITICAL.
# Use Fault.SEVERITY_* constants for type safety.
# Values outside 0-3 range will be rejected (success=false with error message).
uint8 severity

# Human-readable description of the fault condition.
string description

# Identifier of the reporting node/entity. Recommended: fully qualified ROS 2 node name
# including namespace (e.g., "/powertrain/engine/temp_sensor").
# This value is added to the fault's reporting_sources array for multi-source tracking.
string source_id

# Response fields
bool success           # True if the fault was successfully recorded
